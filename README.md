# Sparse-Polynomial

This is a CS-102 project which showcases an implementation of sparse polynomials and their operations using doubly linked lists and a monomial class. The motivation for this project is primarily driven by comparing the cost effectiveness of linked data structures versus arrays, as well as manipulating pointers in a safe and efficient way.
